# Data-Analysis_Customer_Churn_Prediction_-using_PowerBI



**BT Career Challenge**

**Problem Statement:-** BT is one of the biggest telecommunication companies in the UK. They offer so many products and services to the customers and they use different services.**One of the most severe problems in the telecommunications sector is customer churn**. Customer churn is a term used when a customer decides to stop using the services of the business. Businesses do customer churn analysis all the time because it extremely helpful for a company to analyse who are leaving the company.

In this challenge, we were given a dataset containing information that represents customers and the use of services provided by BT. 

**Below are the gaols which needs to be addressed:-**

1. Can you help us understand which customers are highly likely to leave the company?

2. Understand what features are associated with high or low chance of customers leaving us ?

3. Use this insight to suggest what we could do to improve customer retention ?

**Info about Dataset:-**

The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target, showing whether the customer left the company (Churn=’Yes’) or not (Churn=’No’). This is not real BT data, but it’s like the data we use every day.

The dataset includes information about:

•	Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

•	Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

•	Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

•	Demographic info about customers – gender, if they have partners and dependents

An exhaustive list of columns is described below:
